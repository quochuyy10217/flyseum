Flyseum is a Web Development project for academic purposes. It's a little maven webapp where you can easily find flights in the european zone, taking off from Rome :).

It has been made with:
- Java, using Java Servlets as _controllers_, JavaBeans as _model_ and JavaServer Pages as _view_ (MVC pattern)
- MySQL
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Bootstrap in order to make it mobile-first and responsive
- JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX

## Deployment
Flyseum can be deployed with Maven or manually with the .war file.

### Prerequisites
- Maven
